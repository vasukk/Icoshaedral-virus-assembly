# Icoshaedral-virus-assembly

This repository contains a Python-based computational pipeline for constructing complete icosahedral virus capsids from a single monomeric protein subunit. The code applies the full set of 60 rotational symmetry operations that define icosahedral geometry to generate a structurally consistent viral assembly.

The pipeline enables automated construction of capsid structures for downstream structural analysis, visualization, and modeling. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to adapt the symmetry operations or integrate the workflow with molecular visualization and simulation tools.

Potential applications include:

Structural biology and virology research

Comparative analysis of viral capsid architectures

Preparation of full capsid models for simulation or visualization
